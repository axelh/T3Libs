I've already some experience with ATmega and ATtiny in the Arduino IDE. While looking
around for a more powerful alternative I found the new Teensy 3.0 on Kickstarter:

To be able to communicate using the existing RFM12b network I started to implement a
library which brings JeeLabs.org compatible RFM12b wireless networking to the Teensy.

I'm not yet sure how this will evolve. I do have plans for my Teensy 3.0 but time is
limited...

Thanks for your interrest and please send feedback.
